  "FOREWARD": {
    "foreward": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) threatens the very core of modern medicine and the sustainability of an effective, global public health response to the enduring threat from infectious diseases. Effective antimicrobial drugs are prerequisites for both preventive and curative measures, protecting patients from potentially fatal diseases and ensuring that complex procedures , such as aurgery and chemotherapy, can be provided at low risk. Yet systematic misuse and overuse of these drugs in human medicine puts patients at risk due to development of resistance. Few replacement products areÂ  in the pipeline. Without harmonized and immediate action on both local and global scale, the world is heading towards a post-antibiotic era in which common infections could once again kill."
